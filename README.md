# Interactive Prototype 
## Laudan Hosseini, DH110-06

## Introduction 
This project represents a high-fidelity, interactive prototype that makes revisions on the application, Audiobooks HQ.

### Purpose 
The purpose of developing this interactive prototype is to visualize the revisions of the application through more advanced programming, taking into account aesthetic properties as well. This will develop a stronger idea of what the user-friendly application will look like, and it will incorporate thought-out designs for typography, color schemes, and organization. The revisions are centralized around making the application more user-friendly for senior citizens, as reading is a common hobby among this group and it is important for this audience to have accessibility to a virtual space for this activity. 

### Process 
The revisions made to create this high-fidelity prototype were first evaluated through heurisitc evaluation, usability testing, and contextual inquiry. These steps established the basic and initial reactions to the usability of the application. Then, a low-fidelity prototype was created that included wireframe and wireflow sketches to get down the basic features of the app that needed the most improvement. The rough sketches of the wireframes went through prototype testing to get feedback on if the revisions were on the right track, leading us to the development of the high-fidelity prototype. The prototype was created using the tool Figma, and it consists of three wireframes that support the following tasks: 

**1) Navigating the search bar** 

**2) Organizing downloaded/purchased content**

Additional tasks that this high-fidelity prototype supports: 

3) clarifying the homepage 

4) clarifying the separate tabs for separate functions 

5) finding the settings + FAQ section 

## Tasks 
### Task 1: Navigating the Search Bar 
This was one of the main issues that I wanted to improve with the application, Audiobooks HQ. The search bar only had filters that could be changed and refined a bit to make the search process more clear. Furthermore, there was a lot of confusion throughout the usability and low-fidelity prototype tests with locating the search bar in the first place, so I wanted to make sure this step was extremely clear to the user. 

### Task 2: Organizing Downloaded/Purchased Content 
This is the second most important part of the application, as this is where the user is able to access their downloaded products in a quick, interactive format. I wanted to improve this mainly in the sense of interactivity: I wanted the user to be able to create their own tabs for their own, personalized library of content. I also wanted to put this in a section that was not the homepage, so the first-time users can avoid any confusion or overwhelmed emotions.

## Design Variations 
(note: these variations are from the old prototype; the finalized version is different from these, as the final version is based on the suggestions made during the impression test and cognitive walkthrough)

## Impression Test 
The participant did not want to be video or audio recorded, but I walked them through an initial impression test and documented some of her reactions that I found to be most important:
* "I think that I would like an addition of different colors of orange to add more dimension"
* "I really like how you put the pictures of books on the homepage and on those buttons"
* "I would maybe choose a different layout for the last page, I like how you separate the filters into buttons but I would maybe mimick the layout as the page with the buttons for organizing content"
* "This is now definitely easier to see how to search for something than the first time you showed me the application"
* "I like the inclusion of the "Add New" button"
* "I would maybe use a different plus sign on the homepage because it is bulky compared to the rest of the aesthetic"

**Summary:** I found her impression test to be incredibly helpful, as she was also the participant in the contextual inquiry assignment. She definitely noticed a lot of improvements compared to the original app; when she first used the app, she was very confused on how to initially search for books, but she noted how much easier it was to do that with this prototype. I also appreciated her comments on the aesthetics of the app, such as with the slight changes in the orange color scheme and the change in the layout for the search bar page. I will definitely take these into account and refine the prototype further for enhancements.

## Cognitive Walkthrough 

### Goal
The goal for this user's cognitive walkthrough is to complete two main tasks regarding the prototype for the application, Audiobooks HQ. The tasks include (1) navigating the search bar of the app and (2) organizing any downloaded or purchased content. 

### Tasks 
This is the script that I had set up for my user to help guide her through the navigation of the application. 

**Task 1: Navigating the Search Bar**
* click to enter the application 
* click either on "Find Books Now!", "Bookstore", "See All" under the New Noteworthy, or plus sign at the bottom of the homepage
* click on either "Search", one of the letters of the alphabets, or one of the filters listed 
* if clicked on "Search", type in the title of the book desired or the author 
* if clicked on one of the filters, scroll through to find the desired book 

**Task 2: Organizing Downloaded or Purchased Content**
* click to enter the application 
* click either on "My Books", "See All" next to New + Noteworthy, or "See All" next to Made for You
* if clicked on "My Books", select one of the categories 
* once category selected, scroll through options or click "See More" to see more options

### Findings
**1) Will the user try and achieve the right outcome?**
 (Is the interface based on the assumptions about a userâ€™s level of experience or knowledge)
    * Yes, the user is a college student female who is fairly knowledgable in technology and reading heavy texts for her classes. While she does not fit the exact target audience (senior citizens), she has the same reading level as the target audience and should be able to complete these tasks at a faster rate than would a senior citizen. 
    
**2) Will the user notice that the correct action is available to them?**
(Is there any hidden or obscured controls?)
    * The user should be able to find the buttons needed fairly easily, as most of them are either in large text or found on the homepage. The only issue I can predict occurring is the user struggling to "swipe" through the sections "Made for You" and "New + Noteworthy" on the homepage, as this interaction is different from the usual tap that the user has to do to get to other tabs. The swipe feature is more subtle and thus can be harder to figure out. 

**3) Will the user associate the correct action with the outcome they expect to achieve?**
(Are the instruction/button labels clear to understand?)
    * Yes, the buttons are fairly labeled in large text or worded in a way that is clear to the user. For instance, the button "Search" or "Find books now!" clearly points to the reader that if clicked on, these buttons will help find the books you are looking for. 

**4) If the correct action is performed; will the user see that progress is being made towards their intended outcome?**
(Does the interface provide proper feedbacks? Any missing feedbacks or any moment that lacks consistency?)
    * Currently, this interactive prototype does not have any "loading pages" included in the system, so the user can potentially lack in having visual updates, such as with download or loading progress. Everything else, however, clearly guides the user through the steps needed to be taken to achieve the desired goals. 
    
As the user completed these tasks, I found that most of my predictions were correct. The user struggled with finding the swipe portion of the "Made for You" and "New + Noteworthy" sections, but they did not seem to be phased by the lack of loading pages that were included in the prototype. I still think that moving forward, I would want to include some sort of progress signals, and I also maybe want to make the swipe feature more clear (either by changing the wording of the button or changing the font color). Other than these suggestions, the user stated that she found the tasks very easy to complete and did so faster than predicted. 
    Some direct quotes from the walkthrough: 
        * "I would rate the user-friendliness of the tasks an 8.5 out of 10, solely because the swiping part was the most difficult. Everything else was really easy to figure out"
        * "I liked how there were multiple buttons on the homepage that took me to the search engine"
        * "I liked how there were pictures included of the books because that makes it easier to recall when searching" 
        * "I think there could be loading pages included in the prototype to enhance the user-friendliness, but I don't think not including them detracted from this experience"


## Design System 
(note: this is for the old version; the revisions made to the design system is noted in the reflections sections)
* **Typeface:** Oxanium 
    * **Size:** ranging from 12 or 14 for small additions to the pages (Login, See All, Sort By, Support Bar, etc.) 
              font size 18 for labels on buttons on page 2 and "Currently Listening To" on page 1
              font size 24 for titles "Made for You" and "Good Afternoon" on page 1
              font size 30 for titles of boxes on page 3
              font size for 48 for main headers 
       I liked this typeface for the application because I thought it fit the energy of reading pretty well, but it still was something more fun and dynamic than using a basic font like Times New Roman. In addition, at the top right corner of each page, I included a small "aA" button, and this was particularly for senior citizens. This feature allows users to change the size of the font in the app from bigger to smaller, which helps senior citizens as many struggle with blurry vision when looking up close at screens. 
                     
* **Color Scheme:** 
    * **Background:** Shade is Light Orange (F8B16F) 
    * **Primary Text:** Black (000000)
    * **Supplementary Text:** Light Charcoal Gray (6A6A6A) 
    * **Buttons on Page 2 and Page 3:** Light Gray at 46% Opacity (B2B2B2)
 I wanted to keep the orange theme as was put originally in this app to retain some of its main aesthetic elements, but I chose a paler orange shade because I think that it brightened up the pages versus the dark orange that was used. 

* **Layout:**
    * **Page 1:** Recreating a homepage, so at the top there would be the title of the application and information on how to login or immediately search for content. Then I wanted to lead into different tabs filled with general information so it would be one of the first things the user sees; I included "My Books", "Bookstore", "Account", and "Settings". Then, I wanted the user to be able to access the book that was currently being listened to, so I created a section for that underneath the tabs. Next, I wanted the user to be able to browse on the homepage, as this is similar to what other audiobook applications have done and also what Spotify looks like (and I think the Spotify app is very well designed). Thus, I added in a "Made for You" section that is based on an algorithm that picks up onwhat type of content the reader gravitate towards. I think this personalized touch helps keep users engaged with the app and continuing to search for new content to purchase. I also included a "New Releases" section so the user could be kept up to date on recently published books or new books that were added onto the application. I wanted to include the big plus sign that Audiobooks HQ originally had because I think that it was a nice little addition for users to quickly access the search bar or bookstore. Lastly, I included a settings bar at the bottom of the page because I saw Audible does this and think that it is a good way for users to find more help if needed. Here, I included tabs on basic information such as "About", "Conditions of Use", "FAQs", and "Contact Us". 
    * **Page 2:** I wanted to create a completely separate page for organizing downloaded content because it was confusing to have that right on the homepage when the user clicked to enter the application. I wanted to integrate more interactive and dynamic elements, so I arranged the different tabs of organization in bubbles that the user could click on. This also makes it large and visible for older-aged users to be able to just quickly see which area of their content they want to access. I also included a button called "Add New" that would take users to the bookstore immediately so they wouldn't have to go all the way back to the homepage and then click to go to the Bookstore. 
    * **Page 3:** This page is for the bookstore where users can search for what they are looking for. I wanted to include a lot of the filters that Audiobooks HQ had originally, but I removed a couple that I deemed to be unnecessary. I also included an alphabet that users could search based on either Title or Author so they could browse based on letters if needed. 

## Reflection
This week, I took into account what my participant said during the Impression Test as well as the discussions I had during class last week to make revisions to my interactive prototype. These are some of the aesthetic components I changed: 
   * changed color scheme from orange background to a more neutral, grey background with orange accents (less harsh on the eye)
   * added arrows to "Made for You" and "New Releases" so you can scroll sideways to see more options for more books
   * added more wireframes to create a more holistic picture of the interactive prototype 
 
I wanted to add a more detailed wireframe and wireflow for each task so that the user can engage with the interactions and actually try to complete the tasks, as this was essential for the cognitive walkthrough. The walkthrough went much smoother than anticipated, and I am very pleased with how my prototype turned out as a result. The participant was able to really pretend to be a user and was able to complete the tasks efficiently and successfully. Pictured below are the old wireframes to show the changes that I made this week. Moving forward, I will try to refine a couple more things based on aesthetics, such as by finding a more refined "plus sign" graphic for the homepage. I will also potentially add a few more interactions to the prototype to create an even more detailed and holistic perception of the application.
