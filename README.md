# Interactive Prototype 
## Laudan Hosseini DH110-06

## Introduction 
This project represents a high-fidelity, interactive prototype that makes revisions on the application, Audiobooks HQ.

### Purpose 
The purpose of developing this interactive prototype is to visualize the revisions of the application through more advanced programming, taking into account aesthetic properties as well. This will develop a stronger idea of what the user-friendly application will look like, and it will incorporate thought-out designs for typography, color schemes, and organization. The revisions are centralized around making the application more user-friendly for senior citizens, as reading is a common hobby among this group and it is important for this audience to have accessibility to a virtual space for this activity. 

### Process 
The revisions made to create this high-fidelity prototype were first evaluated through heurisitc evaluation, usability testing, and contextual inquiry. These steps established the basic and initial reactions to the usability of the application. Then, a low-fidelity prototype was created that included wireframe and wireflow sketches to get down the basic features of the app that needed the most improvement. The rough sketches of the wireframes went through prototype testing to get feedback on if the revisions were on the right track, leading us to the development of the high-fidelity prototype. The prototype was created using the tool Figma, and it consists of three wireframes that support the following tasks: 

**1) Navigating the search bar 
2) Organizing downloaded/purchased content**

Additional tasks that this high-fidelity prototype supports: 
3) clarifying the homepage 
4) clarifying the separate tabs for separate functions 
5) finding the settings + FAQ section 

## Tasks 
### Task 1: Navigating the Search Bar 
This was one of the main issues that I wanted to improve with the application, Audiobooks HQ. The search bar only had filters that could be changed and refined a bit to make the search process more clear. Furthermore, there was a lot of confusion throughout the usability and low-fidelity prototype tests with locating the search bar in the first place, so I wanted to make sure this step was extremely clear to the user. 

### Task 2: Organizing Downloaded/Purchased Content 
This is the second most important part of the application, as this is where the user is able to access their downloaded products in a quick, interactive format. I wanted to improve this mainly in the sense of interactivity: I wanted the user to be able to create their own tabs for their own, personalized library of content. I also wanted to put this in a section that was not the homepage, so the first-time users can avoid any confusion or overwhelmed emotions.
